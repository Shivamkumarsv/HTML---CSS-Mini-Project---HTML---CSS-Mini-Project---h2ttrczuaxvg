        Cities were always like people, showing their varying personalities to the traveler. Depending on the city and on the traveler,
        there might begin a mutual love, or dislike, friendship, or enmity. Where one city will rise a certain individual to glory, it will
        destroy another who is not suited to its personality. Only through travel can we know where we belong or not, where we are loved and
        where we are rejected.

        I wasnt privy to all of the intelligence that was coming in about Guatemala, but I did see the traffic that was coming in 
        from Guatemala City, because it was very relevant to me, and of course I exchanged 
        what I had with the chief of station in Guatemala City.
